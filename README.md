# ADiffer

https://adiffer.netlify.app

An augmented diff visualizer, like [Achavi](https://overpass-api.de/achavi/), built to perform well on planet scale augmented diffs using MapboxGL + vector tiles.

## Developing

Start the development server with:

```shell
REACT_APP_MAPBOX_API_KEY="<your api key>" npm start
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
